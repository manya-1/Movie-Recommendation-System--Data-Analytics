# Movie-Recommendation-System--Data-Analytics

This is a content-based Movie Recommendation System built using Python and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It suggests the top 10 similar movies based on a user’s input movie using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity.

## Overview
The system analyzes the metadata (plot summaries or textual features) of movies and recommends similar ones by calculating similarity scores between them. It is a lightweight, interpretable solution ideal for personalized movie suggestions.

## 📌 Features
- Content-based filtering using TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency)
- Cosine similarity for measuring movie similarity
- Recommends Top 10 similar movies based on input title
- Clean and modular codebase

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
